## detailed description about files

### friends' work

* svm.ipynb - supervised learning - no cheating on test data - accuracy of 97.5\%

### data

* train.csv and test.csv are original data downloaded from kaggle.

* train_no_id.csv and test_no_id.csv are the data deleted the id.

### output_record

* submission.csv could be used as sample, which has an accuracy of 98.75\%.

* others are just test or trash anyway.

### ref

* contains one project description and two papers

* one is the paper from Tongxin Li

* one is the paper proposed semi-supervised GMM

## things ready to hand in

* an unsupervised GMM with only feature 4 on training data

* an unsuperviesd GMM with full feature on training data

* an ensamble version of SVM by deleting the operation of outlier and using min-max normalization method 

## models need to train

* a semi-supervised GMM

* ensamble model - little svm - then boosting

* you need to justify the label of your unsupervised GMM!!!!!! DONT FORGET THIS!!!!!!!!
